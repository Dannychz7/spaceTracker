Scope for each webpage
-----------------------------------------------
"/" Home.cs
    - Will give basic information about the site as a whole
"/3d" Dashboard3D.cs
    - Will contain a 3d gloab, tracks upcoming rocket launches, satlite launches, and other events
    - Will also contain a tracker for the ISS and where it is on earth
    - Will also track 5 other satlites
    - Each location will have more info about it like launch details, location, etc...
"/2d" Dashboard2D.cs
    - A simpler, easier to run version of dashboard on a 2d map
    - Displays the location of the next 5 launches on the map
    - Selectign a location brings up info about the launch / location
"/launch5" liveLaunchLoader.cs
    - Will contain a dashboard of the next top 5 all next to each other
    - Time and weather will show for current location, so we'll say worcester, ma
    - When clicking on a rocket, it will change color depending on time, weather, wind anitmation, cold, hot, etc... 
    - Each rocket will have a different animation depending on state it is in (ready, prepping, successful launch, etc...)
"/Astronouts"
    - A fun interactive Part here, showcasing famous astronought
    - name, dob, description, flights flown, etc... 
    - Maybe we'll do a search bar and maybe this bookshelf style where the screen is a astronought and the you can click through ? 
    - Something like: "overlay page navigation animation"
    - Another way to explain: a multi-page animated transition effect — where each “page” of the website moves or slides in/out with a smooth animation, almost like flipping through a digital stack of pages or cards.
"/Programs"
    - Same idea but maybe a timeline of the different programs in a timeline loaction

    - /Launches cheese will show 40 upcoming launches
    - /spacecraft
    - /ISS

.... IDK pass this point: 
"/funFacts? "
